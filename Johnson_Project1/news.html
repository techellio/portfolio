Andreasen, the emergency management director for Jackson County, Fla., decided on Friday that it was time to nudge his neighbors back to normalcy.
		<br>
		He started by scaling back on round-the-clock staffing. Then he turned to the county’s eight multiagency “points of distribution” — known as PODs — which have been handing out free drinking water, ice, canned goods, hot meals, diapers, garbage bags, and the most coveted item of all, toilet paper.
		<br>
		Seven of the sites would have to be shut down within the next few days, he told unhappy local officials, with only the handout point in Cottondale, west of town, to stay in operation.
		<br>
		“Yes, yes, yes, we are consolidating the PODs — and yes, yes, yes, people are getting upset,” Mr. Andreasen, 59, said in his office, surrounded by boots, guns and clothes he rescued after Hurricane Michael’s winds destroyed his own house out in the countryside. “But we are doing it.”
		<br>
		“The grocery stores are starting to come on line, and we want to start pumping money back into the economy,” said Mr. Andreasen, who worries a green fidget spinner to work off excess energy. “If people are getting food for free, they aren’t going to the stores, so the stores can’t pay people, and so on and so on — the ripple effect. So I get to be the bad guy. I’ve got to make that call.”
		<br>	
		But many in Jackson County are simply not ready for the hurricane relief to end. There is a feeling, fair or not, that officials — even the well-liked Mr. Andreasen — are moving too fast, chasing the image of normalcy before a real recovery has taken root. That feeling of being hurried, and eventually left behind — the normalizing of a catastrophe — is a growing worry for people who are caught between a short-attention-span country that has seen one disaster after another and the long-term effort it takes to rebuild battered lives.<p id="source">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/fema-hurricane-michael-disaster-damage.html</p></div>

Hurricane Michael’s 155mph (250km/h) winds at landfall were only 5mph short of category five status, making it the US’s strongest storm since Hurricane Andrew ravaged southern Florida in 1992.<br>

Michael sprang quickly from a weekend tropical depression, going from a category two on Tuesday to a category four storm by the time it came ashore.<br>
			
			Landfall happened just north of Mexico Beach, Florida, a small coastal town 25 miles (40km) east of Panama City with a population of 1,000, at about 1.30pm local time on Wednesday. According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the storm blew in with sustained winds of 155mph and travelling at 14mph.<br>
			
			Television pictures showed broken and uprooted trees and downed power lines. Roofs were peeled away and swept into the air, and homes were split open by fallen trees. Twisted road signs lay on the ground. Palm trees whipped wildly in the winds.<br>
			
			Vance Beu, 29, was staying with his mother at her home in a complex of single-storey, wood-framed buildings, where they piled up mattresses for protection. A pine tree punched a hole in the roof and his ears popped when the atmospheric pressure fell. The roar of the winds, he said, sounded like a jet engine.<br>

“It was terrifying, honestly. There was a lot of noise. We thought the windows were going to break at any time,” Beu said.<br>

Louis Uccellini, the director of the National Weather Service, told CNN: “When people … start making their assessments, they’re going to realise just how powerful a category four storm can be. You’re going to see a very extensive area of damaging winds all the way into central Georgia.”<br>

Michael weakened to a tropical storm as it moved inland, but is on course to hit parts of Georgia, and North and South Carolina, still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month.<br>

The NHC in Miami said the eye of Michael was about 30 miles south-west of Macon in central Georgia at midnight on Thursday. The storm had sustained winds of up to 70mph.<br>

Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said: “The citizens of Georgia need to wake up and pay attention. The bottom line is it’s going to be the worst storm south-west and central Georgia has seen in many decades.
<br>
“They need to be prepared, not only in Florida but Georgia as well, to see the power off for multiple weeks.”
